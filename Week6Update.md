Week 6 Status - Sanchez

What did you do last week?

* Finished weather application. This took up a lot of my time, I spent a lot of time working on this and looking through different tutorials. 

What do you plan to do this week?

* Start second application, this will be the game application. 
* Watch more Youtube videos on Swift.
* Finish Udacity Course

Are there any impediments in your way?

* For me the biggest impediment is time. I think I get bogged down on things with this project and may need to focus more on my plan. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

* I once again used the tools that are out there on Youtube, I think this is the easiest way for me to learn and I like the visual, while being walked through some things.
