Project Proposal - Learn Swift

Vision statement:
I will use different resources to learn a new programming language that we do not cover in other classes and build a complete application. 

Motivation: 
Swift has always been a language that I want to explore more. Being an avid Apple user, I always wanted to know more about iOS development and I would like to use this time to expand my knowledge here. This will also help me to explore potential areas in that may be interested in once this degree is complete. 

Learning Objectives:
* Complete the free Udacity course - Swift for Beginners
* Create a weather app within swift - This will help to learn more about APIs.
* Create a Financial app within swift - This will help to learn more about Databases with swift. 
* Create a game within swift - Depending on time this may be a simple tic-tac-toe game or something more complicated. 

Risks to project completion:
The biggest risk is that I have no experience within Swift so I will be learning something completely new. 

Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above:
The resources to learn Swift are very accessible and there are plenty of resources across Youtube, Udacity, or even Udemy. The apple created guides to swift seem fairly user friendly as well so I think that all the goals should be attainable. 

Project Assessments:
* Completion of the free Udacity course.
* Completion of weather application
* Completion of Finance Application
* Completion of a game application
