Mid Semester Update

Proposed Goals at beginning of Semester: 

* Complete the free Udacity course - Swift for Beginners
* Create a weather app within swift - This will help to learn more about APIs.
* Create a Financial app within swift - This will help to learn more about Databases with swift. 
* Create a game within swift - Depending on time this may be a simple tic-tac-toe game or something more complicated.

Assessment: 

* Complete the free Udacity course - Swift for Beginners: This goal is complete, this gave me a good initial foundation to swift, but I do not think that I got as much as I needed out of this and if I were to do it over agian I may look for a different course. 
* Create a weather app within swift - This will help to learn more about APIs: This is complete as well, this one I had a lot of fun with and I think that I learned a lot from this. Using the hands on learning was very enjoyable for me and I think that I learned the best this way. 
* Create a Financial app within swift - This will help to learn more about Databases with swift: This one I have not worked on yet, this is still a goal to complete by the end of the semester I think that it is still very attainable. 
* Create a game within swift - Depending on time this may be a simple tic-tac-toe game or something more complicated: This is the goal that I am currently working one. I am working on a trivia app and will continue to work on this the next couple of weeks and hope to be done soon. This was has been very enjoyable and I plan to work on a future goals and Swift projects in a similar process.

Updated Goals: 

* Finish the game app, this goal is to finish the trivia app that I am currently working on, this will be easy to finish in the next couple of weeks and working on real projects like this has really helped me to implement my increasing knowledge in Swift while still learning more.
* Create Financial app. This goal seems very attainable both by what I have learned, but also by what resources are out there to help learn these types of things. This one I am really looking forward to.
