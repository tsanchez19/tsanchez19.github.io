Week 5 Status - Sanchez

What did you do last week?

* Watched Youtube Videos to get ideas:
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulp1Kimblg0
* Continued to play around is Swift and get more familiar. 

What do you plan to do this week?

* Finish the weather application. 
* Start second application, I am thinking the game as it sounds enjoyable. 
* Watch more Youtube videos on Swift. 
* Finish Udacity Course

Are there any impediments in your way?

* I think the biggest impediment right now is trying to create a schedule and not get lost. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

* I think that I have a pretty good process going now, the Youtube videos now are really helping to get a better grasp on Swift. I think that combined with hands on learning is working best.
