Week 10 Status - Sanchez

What did you do last week?

* This last week, I started working on the financial application. This one has been fun and I am starting to add my own twist to the application using the knowledge that I have learned. I am using Youtube tutorials still, but feel that I am using them less and less as I understand swift better. 

What do you plan to do this week?

* This week I will finish the work on the financial application. I will continue to use the tutorials, but keep trying to use them less and less for the simple stuff. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

* I have no impediments right now, I am enjoying what I am learning, which is helping a lot. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

* I really like the process that I have now. There are a lot of resources out there to help learn swift which helps and lot and when I get stuck it is easy to find help to get going in the right direction agian.
