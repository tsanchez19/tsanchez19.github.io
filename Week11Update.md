Week 10 Status - Sanchez

What did you do last week?

* Last week I worked more on the financial application and watched more youtube videos on swift. I am starting to learn more by watching because I have a better base understanding of Swift so I can follow along better and start to understand bigger topics. 

What do you plan to do this week?

* I will work this week to finish the financial application and continue to explore more about Swift through Youtube. This is a great, free way for me to continue to learn. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

* I currently still do not have any impediments, I think that I have a good routine and am able to continue my knowledge growth in Swift. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

* The process that I have now is very standard and works well for me. I like using videos and tutorials to follow a long and just learn from. I think that I have a good process for the future to learn new coding languages.
