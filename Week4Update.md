* Continued to play around is Swift and get more familiar. 

What do you plan to do this week?
* Work on the weather application. 
* Possibly start second application. 
* Continue to watch more videos and get more familiar and comfortable within Xcode. 

Are there any impediments in your way?
* I think that the biggest impediment right now is time and how much I would like to dive further into Swift and completing what needs to be completed for the course.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* I am starting to get into a good routine, I am really enjoying learning Swift and am really excited to learn more. The process of using the course along side the videos is helping me to learn a lot. I am also adding on a lot of hands on learning which is making it very enjoyable.
