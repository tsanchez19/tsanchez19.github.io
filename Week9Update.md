Week 9 Status - Sanchez

What did you do last week?

* Last week, I was able to finish the trivia app. It is not the prettiest thing in the world, but it does work. I think that this week things really started to click with Swift and I am making good strides in learning more about it and being able to implement what I have learned. 

What do you plan to do this week?

* This week I will work on the financial application. I dont exactly have a plan on tackling this yet, but I think I want to try and do this more independently and try not to rely as much on the tutorials. 

Are there any impediments in your way?

* I am not running into any specific impediments right now, just trying to keep learning and keep using the skills that I have learned. 

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

* I am really enjoying learning swift, I think that this is a good skill to have and I am excited to continue learning more.
