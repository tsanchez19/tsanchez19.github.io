Week 2 Status - Sanchez

What did you do last week?
* I worked on my project proposal and added it to my website. 
* I built my GitHub website. 
* Researched swift apps that are good to learn in the beginning. 
* Researched a beginner course to take to learn swift.
What do you plan to do this week?
* Work on course for beginner Swift
* Begin first project to build the weather app. 
* Learn more of the basics of Swift.
Are there any impediments in your way?
* None
Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
* With this being the first week, I am still working out the process. I think that I need to make sure to stay ahead of the game and work on my projects early in the week in order to not fall behind. I also need to try to set clear goals for each week ahead of time.
